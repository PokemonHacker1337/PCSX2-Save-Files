# PCSX2-Save-Files

These are my save files from Playstation games played using the emulator PCSX2. 

Cars Mater National Championship:
Everything unlocked, all 350 bolt banners, all wheels, all paint jobs, all vehicles bought 100% story completion. Note: It is impossible to permanently unlock Expert as it is locked behind a cheat, which gets reset upon reloading. To unlock Expert difficulty, you must go to Options → Cheat Codes → and enter the code VRYFAST. You should hear the sound of a car chirping to confirm that the code was entered correctly, afterwards it will return you back to the options menu.
