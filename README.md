# PCSX2-Save-Files

These are my save files from Playstation games played using the emulator PCSX2. 

Cars Mater National Championship:
Everything unlocked, all 350 bolt banners, all wheels, all paint jobs, all vehicles bought 100% story completion. Note: It is impossible to permanently unlock Expert as it is locked behind a cheat, which gets reset upon reloading. To unlock Expert difficulty, you must go to Options → Cheat Codes → and enter the code VRYFAST. You should hear the sound of a car chirping to confirm that the code was entered correctly, afterwards it will return you back to the options menu.

Cars: the Video Game:
248/250 trophies (couldn't bother finding the last 2 of Lizzie's postcards, but I know the missing ones are in Tailfin Pass), all chapters and missions complete (except for Lizzie's Postcard Hunt), all 3 boost tanks. Note: contrary to guides on the Internet, you cannot unlock Boost, Tia, Mack, etc as playable characters. 

RPM Tuning:
Start with a fully upgraded car at the final mission (Note: completing the final mission resets your car and money in adventure mode), lots of money in tune and race mode, almost all cars unlocked for quick race (complete the final mission of adventure mode to unlock the final car).
